# Cornell Thrift's Website
> Flask-based, PWA

Cornell Thrift's new website for the 2019-2020 school year. 

Current code is a quick prototype I threw together – future updates are planned to have the website backed by DB, and allow updates through a login system.

Live version hosted at [Heroku](https://cornell-thrift.herokuapp.com).
